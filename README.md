dotfiles
========

Yeah, dotfiles.

#### Setup 

`bundle`

`rake`

Open an new shell.

#### Things to do

Some things might not work, like YCM/Command-T for vim. The rakefile is garbage and should be rewritten to be more Rake-y.

Need to have a way to delete a link if the link is also deleted from this repository, and also need to set up a "clean" task.
